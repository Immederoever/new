# Reflection

## Peer feedback

On June 20, 2024, our project group, F3, gathered with another group for a peer feedback session, where we had the opportunity to present our progress from the past two weeks. They provided us with feedback on both our strengths and areas for improvement.

Here is a list of the feedback provided by the other group and our TA that could be improved:
- Remove graphs that do not contribute to the data story.
- Add more detailed descriptions for the graphs and visuals.
- Reorganize some of the graphs (e.g., place some next to each other) and explore ways to combine multiple variables to create more meaningful graphs.

After the feedback session, we divided the tasks so that each team member had a specific feedback point to work on.

## Self-reflection
If we had more time for this project, our main goal would be to improve our graphs and find the best ways to visualize the data. This includes experimenting with different types of graphs and styles to make our findings clearer and more understandable. We would also like to include more variables in our analysis and solve the problem of defining what 'normal food' means in our context.

Overall, we were very pleased with the communication within our team, which ensured everything went smoothly, and we look forward to enhancing our data visualizations and broadening our analysis in future endeavors.
