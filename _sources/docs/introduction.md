This data story aims to explore the many factors that contribute to obesity using data analysis. By looking at various influences, we hope to understand the complex reasons behind this epidemic. Our data comes from national health surveys and other trusted sources, giving us a strong base for our analysis.

We will focus on the connection between obesity rates in the United States and factors like diet quality, income levels, and voting behaviour. By studying these variables, we aim to see how lifestyle choices, economic conditions, and political factors play a role in obesity.

Join us as we explore the data to uncover the different factors that influence obesity.
