# Work distribution

During this project we kept each other updated via WhatsApp, sharing our current tasks and maintaining a to-do list to track completed work, ongoing tasks, and what still needed to be done. Once we descided on the topic we would like to research, we divided the tasks among the team members.

Our first step was to find relevant datasets, followed by preprocessing and cleaning them. With the cleaned and preprocessed data, we created graphs to visualize the correlations between variables to support the two 
different perspectives. During the project we received peer feedback, which we implemented to improve our project. With the remaining time after the feedback session, we completed the final data story.


## Imme

At the beginning of the project Imme focused on searching for relevant datasets for the project. She also participated in making the graphs to represent the data and was responsible for setting up the URL for our project site.

## Lise

Lise assisted in looking for useable datasets to use for the project and was responsible for cleaning the data. She also contributed to creating visuals and made sure the project notebook looked visually appealing and consistent.

## Eva

Eva was responsible for continuing the process of cleaning the datasets and merging them. After finishing this task she wrote sections on reflection, dataset and preprocessing, and the work distribution.

## Xavier

Xavier played a role in writing the project's introduction. Additionally, he was responsible for writing text throughout the project, such as the narrative for the data story and the captions underneath the graphs.
